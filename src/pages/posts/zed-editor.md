I'm a long time VS Code user. When I started coding in Java an age ago I used Eclipse, which back then, somehow, was a state-of-the art tool for Java development.
Now we have IntelliJ, but that's a whole different story. Later in life I've visited other editors before landing on VS Code. Sublime, Atom, and Visual Studio to mention a few.
However, I felt that VS Code really had something the others were lacking for web development, and that was exstensiveness.
<br><br>
The other editors (save for Visual Studio), lacked a comprehensive ecosystem for extensions. This, coupled together with the fact that VS Code was fast and lightweight enough
(at least compared to advanced IDE's like Visual Studio), made me make the switch to VS Code. And I've stayed here since. Now, however, this editor is threadened to become
dethroned as my go-to editor by a new, Rust-based and even faster text editor. Namely Zed.
<br><br>
<p class="fact-box">Zed comes from the team behind the Electron based Atom, an editor that was sunset after
Microsoft's acquisition. Zed takes a completely different approach by using Rust for its core architecture.
Can they garantuee that it won't meet the same fate as Atom?</p>

## First Impressions

Opening Zed for the first time, the contrast with VSCode is immediate. The interface is remarkably clean, almost stark in its simplicity. There's no activity bar, no status bar cluttered with extensions, and no command palette flooding you with hundreds of options. It's just you and your code.

The minimalism isn't just aesthetic - it's philosophical. Zed focuses on doing a few things exceptionally well rather than trying to be everything for everyone. The built-in features are thoughtfully chosen and well-implemented:

- Syntax highlighting that's both beautiful and performant
- Intelligent code completion that feels natural
- Split editing that works exactly as you'd expect
- Built-in terminal that's actually pleasant to use

## The Rust Factor

The decision to build Zed in Rust isn't just a technical detail - it's a game-changer. Where VSCode can sometimes feel sluggish, especially with multiple extensions, Zed maintains its responsiveness regardless of what you throw at it. Opening large files, running multiple terminals, or working with complex projects - the editor remains smooth and stable.

## Is It Really a VSCode Killer?

While Zed is impressive, calling it a "VSCode killer" might be premature. VSCode's ecosystem is vast, and its integration with services like GitHub Copilot and Azure is deeply entrenched in many developers' workflows. What Zed offers instead is a compelling alternative for developers who:

- Value performance over extensive customization
- Prefer a minimalistic, focused environment
- Want native performance without the overhead of Electron
- Miss Atom's philosophy but want modern technology

## Current Limitations

It's important to note that Zed is still in its early stages. Some developers might miss:

- The extensive extension marketplace of VSCode
- Certain language-specific features
- Deep integration with cloud services
- The vast array of themes and customization options

## The Verdict

Zed isn't trying to be VSCode, and that's exactly what makes it interesting. It's a fresh take on what a modern code editor can be - fast, focused, and free from bloat. While it may not "kill" VSCode, it's definitely carving out its own niche in the developer ecosystem.

For those feeling overwhelmed by VSCode's complexity or yearning for the simplicity of Atom with modern performance, Zed presents an exciting alternative. It's not about replacing VSCode - it's about providing a different philosophy of what coding tools can be.
